  <h1 class="bio">Bio</h1>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I am a BAS in Mechanical Engineering from Washington University with a passion for unconventional and elegant design. I know SOLIDWORKS, AutoCAD, and I've worked in MATLAB and Arduino. I've designed and milled parts used on active production lines. My on-the-job training in 5S and Kaizen has shaped the way I view the production process.</p>
    <p>Over the past several years, I've taught myself Illustrator, Photoshop, After Effects, and Premiere. I've designed and sold t-shirts out of my basement, and I'm always looking for a way to practice my graphic design skills.</p>
    <p>Baseball was my first love and as my baseball career ebbed, I discovered my passion for coaching. I've been honing my instructional skills coaching pitchers for the club baseball team and at my high school alma mater. I'm currently about 70 pages into a book teaching success in pitching, drawing from nearly 16 years of playing experience up to and including the college level.</p>
	<p>My goal is to promote the much neglected mental/psychological side of baseball, and it's always gratifying to see how lessons in baseball can translate to any facet of life.</p>
    <p>My various experiences have taught me that it's better to be ingenious than genius. Applying what you know is just as important as having the knowledge in the first place. And engineering is about creating long-term solutions rather than just solving immediate problems. </p>
